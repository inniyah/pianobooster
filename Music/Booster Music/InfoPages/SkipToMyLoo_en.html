<p>For <b>Skip To My Loo</b> start with both thumbs on <b>middle C</b> and then use one finger for each white note on the piano.

 So for the first two notes which are <b>E</b> of the piece you would use the middle finger of your right hand </p>
<p> This piece introucdes the use of two hands as the melody goes across <b>middle C</b></p>

<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Hint:</b> <i>
Make sure you always keep using the correct finger for each note.
