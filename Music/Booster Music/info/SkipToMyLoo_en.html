<p>For <b>Skip To My Loo</b> start with both thumbs on <b>middle C</b> and then use one finger for each white note on the piano.

 So for the first two notes which are <b>E</b> of the piece you would use the middle finger of your right hand </p>
<p> This piece introucdes the use of two hands as the melody goes across <b>middle C</b></p>

<p>Note: <i>If you are a complete beiginner try the pieces from the beginner book first</i></p>
