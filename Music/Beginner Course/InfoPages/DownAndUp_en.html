<b>Down And Up</b> is mirror version of the Up And Down piece we played earlier but this version uses your <b>left hand</b>.
These are the top five notes of the scale of C major. Again try to use all your fingers.

Use your <b>thumb</b> for <b>C</b>, your <b>index finger</b> for <b>D</b>, . . . ,
all the way down to your <b>little finger</b> for <b>G</b>.
