   INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================================

   Piano Booster is a MIDI file player that displays the musical notes AND teaches you how to
   play the piano. You can play along to any track in the midi file and PianoBooster will
   follow YOUR playing.  PianoBooster makes sight reading fun!

   Piano Booster is a free (Open Source) program available from:

                 <http://pianobooster.sourceforge.net/>


===============================================================================================
   REQUIREMENTS
===============================================================================================

   To run Piano Booster you need a MIDI Piano Keyboard and a MIDI-USB interface if the keyboard
   does not have a USB interface. (If you don't have a MIDI keyboard you can still try out 
   PianoBooster using the computer's keyboard, 'x' is middle C).

   To hear music from the computer you will need a General Midi compatible sound synthesizer.
   While there are many possible choices for the Mac (Timidity, FluidSynth or an external MIDI
   Synth), the easiest way is to use SimplSynth, which can be obtained for free (MIT license)
   from:

                 <http://notahat.com/simplesynth>

   This must be started before Pianobooster, and also allows to load custom Soundfonts.

   MIDI FILES
===============================================================================================

   To run PianoBooster you will need some Midi files preferably with right and left piano
   parts on channels 4 and 3. Some high quality demo MIDI files that are compatible with
   PianoBooster are available on the PianoBooster download page see:

         <http://pianobooster.sourceforge.net/download.html>

   INSTRUCTIONS
===============================================================================================

   Double Click on the DMG file containing PianoBooster, then just drag the pianobooster.app
   file wherever you wish (/Application folder is suggested).

   Once the Piano Booster application starts up you must first setup the midi input and midi
   output interface from the Setup menu. Next open a midi file ".mid" or a karaoke ".kar" file
   using File/Open from the Piano Booster menu. Now choose the skill level, if you want to
   just listen to the midi music  -- select 'listen', to play along with a midi keyboard with
   the music following your playing -- select 'follow you'. Finally click on the Play icon to
   start.

   It is recommended that you shut down all other programs whilst running Piano Booster so that
   the scrolling notes move smoothly across the screen.
