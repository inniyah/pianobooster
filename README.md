PianoBooster is a fun way of playing along with a musical accompaniment and at the same time learning the basics of reading musical notation. The difference between playing along to a CD or a standard midi file is that PianoBooster listens and follows what you are playing on a midi piano keyboard.

## About PianoBooster

PianoBooster is a free (Open Source) program that plays Standard Midi Files and allows you to change the speed of playback and transpose the music etc. There is a scrolling musical stave that shows the notes for just one part from all the parts in the complete musical arrangement. 

PianoBooster has been designed to allow you to play along on a midi piano keyboard with the scrolling notes shown on the screen. The notes you press on the keyboard appear as coloured lines on the musical stave, the colour of which depends whether you have pressed the right or wrong note.

A different musical instrument sound is used for your playing depending whether you are playing the right or wrong notes. This feature also allows PianoBooster to be used with printed sheet music so you can hear if you are playing the right notes while at the same time keeping your eyes on the printed score. The music accompaniment will automatically wait for you to find and play the correct notes in the piece.

Piano Booster is piano teaching software that can provide piano lessons for beginners as well as for advanced players. It can be used for teaching music theory and is useful for piano practice and learning piano technique.

## Features

 * Piano Booster follows your playing when playing along to a musical accompaniment. (If you stop then so does the music).
 * Play a single hand and Piano Booster will play the other hand in time with you (and will also play the violins, the bass, the drums etc. in time with you).
 * Change the speed of playback to match your playing ability.
 * Transpose +/- 12 semitones without stopping the play back.
 * Change the Key Signature of the piece.
 * Plays any standard midi or kar file.
 * Play along to any instrument in the midi file.
 * Adjust the volume of the current part or the volume your piano part.
 * See the accuracy of you playing.
 * Change the start bar to start playing from any bar in the music. The repeat bars allows you to practice just a few difficult bars continuously.
 * Timing markers are white crosses that are drawn over each note and show if you are playing ahead or behind the beat.
 * A different instrument sound is used for the right and wrong notes that you play.
